# About Constexpr

Introduced in C++11

It can be applied in two cases:
1. When declaring a value (constexpr int - will say this is a literal type)
2. For declaring functions and constructors (evaluated at compile time .. ?? )


Example values:

    constexpr int const_3 = 3;
    constexpr double half = 0.5;
    static_assert(half < const_3, "Yes") // <- this is evaluated at compile time
    constexpr char tile_fixative[] = "grout";
    static_assert(tile_fixative[5] == '\0', "Yes"); // <- this is evaluated at compile time

    // basically static_assert is used at compile time, similar to static_cast<>

Q: What is the difference between "constexpr" and "static const"?
A: They are interchangeable for values like const_3 and half .. this depends when we get to more complex types

Example functions:

void free_func() {
    constexpr float pi = 3.14159265; // constexpr will make sure that this is initialized at compile time 
    // which is great for race conditions like two different threads that try to access this because the value will already be initialized

    static_assert((3.1 < pi) && (pi < 3.2), "Yes");
}
