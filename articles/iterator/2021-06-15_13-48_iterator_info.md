# A short introduction:
If you took some time to learn about design patterns you will most likely run into a reference to or people just saying to look over the "gang of 4" book, which refers to the book: Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides and, as you can tell, this a mouth full, thus "the gang of 4" expression was born.

# What is an iterator?
The definition of the iterator is kind of vague and doesn't explain much: "Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing the underlining representation". 

We can understand from the first part of this definition that the iterator will access elements of an aggregate and the aggregate would be something that holds data in a sequence of some sort, for example, an array of integers is an aggregate that holds integers in a sequence. Why would you even care about creating a different way of accessing elements within an array when you could simply increment the pointer, you might ask, well, complex aggregates like trees, graphs and lists are not that simple to iterate over not everything needs to have an iterator implementation and it's up to you to know when you should create one. 

So what about the second part: "without exposing the underlining representation", what does this mean? For a simple array that holds integers we know that the memory allocated for each element is contiguous in memory and we simply have to increment the pointer starting with the first element to traverse the array and to do this you don't care about how the array was constructed you know that for any array you could just use a for loop to go over each element, now getting back to the question, when the data structure is complex to know how to iterate over it you would have to understand how it was written, which can be difficult, not to mention the testing time you would spend to make sure you got it right, but if you would have an iterator you would know immediately how to use it and you wouldn't care about how the structure was written because all iterators are used in the same manner.

## example:
   The vector class exposes an iterator:

        std::vector<type>::iterator myItr = myVector.begin(); // what this does is just simply return a pointer to the first element in the vector

        // we can simply for loop over the items using the iterator
        for (; myItr != myVector.end(); ++myItr)
        {
            // print them out
        }

        // You could simply use a for each loop to get the items directly
        for (auto& item : myVector)
        {
            // print them out
        }

The great thing about an iterator is that with the above code you could simply change the data structure from a vector to a set or a list or even a map (any structure you can think about) and it will work the exact same way.

# How to write an iterator?
Now that, hopefully, we can understand what an iterator is, we can take a look at an example that implements an iterator over a singly linked list. 

Just as a refresher a singly linked list is a linear data structure, however, unlike arrays, the elements are NOT stored in a contiguous block of memory, they can be stored anywhere there is room in memory and each element keeps a pointer to the next one. 

Note that in this exercise we will be using smart pointers (specifically unique_ptr) so that we don't have to wary about freeing the memory manually for the stored data. If you're not familiar with smart pointers there is a lot of great information out there about them.

Alright, what do we need to do first?
We need to have some sort of a structure where can store some data and the link to the next element:

    struct Node
    {
        using node_ptr = std::unique_ptr<Node>;

        Data data{}; // what we store
        node_ptr next = nullptr; // link to the next element
    };

We then need to write a class that will represent our list and because we don't care too much about what type our data is will create a template class that can accept all sorts of data.

In the code below I've added the Node as an inner class and in most cases, this is fine because the node is rather specific to our structure:

    template <typename Data>
    class LinkedList
    {
    private:
        // the node holds only the data we want to store
        // and the link to the next node in the list
        struct Node
        {
            using node_ptr = std::unique_ptr<Node>;
            Data data{};
            node_ptr next = nullptr;
        };
        using node_ptr = std::unique_ptr<Node>;

        // we always need to know where the link starts, thus we need a head node
        node_ptr head = nullptr;

        // we also need to keep track of how many numbers are in the list
        std::size_t size = 0;

    public:
        ...
    };

As you might have noticed I've added a head that will always be the first node in the list and size where we keep track of the number of elements in the list. Keeping track of the number of elements in the list is useful to find out if the list is empty without having to go through the list, for this, we can build these two methods:

    std::size_t l_size() const noexcept { return size; }; // gets back the size of the list (hence the l_ in the name)
    bool isEmpty() const { return l_size() == 0; }; // checks if the size is zero which indicates that the list is empty

Now we can think about what can the list do and like any data structure, the list should be able to add an element to the list which can be the following operations: adding to the front of the list, adding to the back of the list and inserting an element at a certain position.

Adding to the front is simple enough, we just have to check if the list is empty in which case we create the head and if the list is not empty we create a new node that points to the head and then we reset the head to the new node and increment size:

    void push_front(const Data& data) 
    {
        // if the list is empty we're going to add head
        if (isEmpty())
        {
            head = std::make_unique<Node>(data, nullptr);
        }
        else
        {
            node_ptr newNode = std::make_unique<Node>(data, nullptr);
            newNode->next = std::move(head);
            head = std::move(newNode);
        }
        size++;
    };

Adding to the back involves going through the list because we can't access any elements directly except for the head:

    void push_back(const Data& data) noexcept
    {
        // if the list is empty we're going to add head
        if (isEmpty())
        {
            head = std::make_unique<Node>(data, nullptr);
        }
        else
        {
            Node* current = head.get();
            while (current->next != nullptr)
            {
                current = current->next.get();
            }
            current->next = std::make_unique<Node>(data, nullptr);
        }
        size++;
    }

We will talk about inserting an element later on when we get to the Iterator implementation.

A list should also be able to remove an element and clear the entire list. I'll add here only the clear method, you can think about how to remove an element based on this example:

    void clear() noexcept
    {
        if (!isEmpty())
        {
            Node* current = head.get();
            while (current != nullptr)
            {
                Node* temp = current;
                temp = nullptr;
                current = current->next.get();
            }
            head = nullptr;
            size = 0;
        }
    }

Something that can be useful in certain situations is to reverse the list. Reversing the list is not something that is straightforward for many people, I've struggled to grasp the idea myself. What happens when we need to reverse the list, or at least how this made sense in my head, is to change the direction of the links, which means that head will now link to null, the next node from head will point to head and so on until we reach the last node that will be set back to head:

    void reverse() noexcept
    {
        // to reverse the list we simply have to switch the nodes until the head becomes the tail
        node_ptr current;
        current = std::move(head);
        node_ptr next = nullptr;
        node_ptr temp = nullptr;

        while (current != nullptr)
        {
            next = std::move(current->next);
            current->next = std::move(temp);
            temp = std::move(current);
            current = std::move(next);
        }
        head = std::move(temp);
    }

We talked about some interesting stuff, but we also have to talk about some of the necessary things that we have to write in our list so that it functions properly and I'm referring to the rule of 5 which we cannot escape from because our data is not trivial. The rule of 5 states that if you create either of these: a copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, or a destructor then you have to create all 5.

    // copy constructor
    LinkedList(const LinkedList& other) noexcept
    {
        // the copy constructor will have to go through all the nodes in other and make a copy of them into our list
        // for that we need to be able to add the new nodes to this list, basically we need to copy the data and recreate the links
        std::cout << "*** Copy constructor ***" << '\n';
        if (other.head == nullptr) return;

        head = std::make_unique<Node>(other.head->data); // we need to know who head is - thus it needs to be initialized separately 
        Node* current = head.get();
        size = 1;

        Node* otherCurrent = other.head->next.get();
        while (otherCurrent != nullptr)
        {
            current->next = std::make_unique<Node>(otherCurrent->data);
            otherCurrent = otherCurrent->next.get();
            current = current->next.get();
            size++;
        }
    }

    // copy assignment operator
    LinkedList& operator=(const LinkedList& other) noexcept
    {
        std::cout << "*** Copy assignment operator ***" << '\n';
        LinkedList tempList(other);
        head.swap(tempList.head);
        std::swap(size, tempList.size);
        return *this;
    }

    // move constructor
    LinkedList(LinkedList&& other) noexcept
    {
        std::cout << "*** Move constructor ***" << '\n';
        head.swap(other.head);
        size = other.size;

        other.head = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;
    }

    // move assignment operator
    LinkedList& operator=(LinkedList&& other) noexcept
    {
        std::cout << "*** Move assignment operator ***" << '\n';
        this->clear();

        head.swap(other.head);
        size = other.size;

        other.head = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;

        return *this;
    }

    // nodes are managing their own memory using unique_ptr
    ~LinkedList() noexcept {};

Aside from the rule of 5 semantics, I would like to add a special constructor that can make like easier for most people to use our structure. The constructor will create a list of elements from an initializer list.
An initializer list is one of the great things in C++ and it looks like this: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 3432, 43, 4, 32 } - and you probably have seen this a lot. So let's see how we can implement it:

    LinkedList(std::initializer_list<Data> listOfItems) noexcept
    {
        if (listOfItems.size() != 0)
        {
            auto it = listOfItems.begin(); // will use the iterator for the list to get the first element
            head = std::make_unique<Node>(*it); // The head is our first element
            size++; // added first item
            Node* current = head.get();
            ++it;
            for (; it != listOfItems.end(); ++it) // we traverse the list using the defined iterator
            {
                current->next = std::make_unique<Node>(*it);
                current = current->next.get();
                size++;
            }
        }
    };

You would ask yourself: "why didn't we just use push_front or push_back?" - well, push front will give us back the list but in the reverse order which will not resemble the give initializer list and push_back will be an O(n^2) operation because we have to reposition to the back for each element in the list.

Now, before we move on to actually implement the iterator let's talk about what would be your first thought on just printing each element in the list. the first go-to would be to build up a simple method that will go through the list and print each element since we already know how to traverse it.

So let's do that! here is a simple method that just prints out each node:

    void printList() const
    {
        if (isEmpty())
        {
            std::cout << "Empty list" << '\n';
        }
        else
        {
            Node* current = head.get();
            while (current != nullptr)
            {
                std::cout << std::string(*current) << '\n';
                current = current->next.get();
            }        
        }
    }

I'll add that to successfully convert a node to string I've added a conversion operator to the Node structure that will use a custom to_string function which can convert anything convertible to string:
        
    operator std::string() const
    {
        return helper::to_string(this->data);
    }

The helper namespace looks like this:
    namespace helper
    {
        // these expressions will be evaluated at compile time
        template <typename T>
        constexpr typename std::enable_if<!std::is_convertible<T, std::string>::value, std::string>::type
        to_string(const T &val) // cannot be converted directly thus we have to use type traits to determine if we can use to_string
        {
            return std::to_string(val);
        };

        template <typename T>
        constexpr typename std::enable_if<std::is_convertible<T, std::string>::value, std::string>::type
        to_string(const T &val) // converts to string directly
        {
            return val;
        };
    }

Using the printList list method will be easy:

    int main()
    {
        // will make a list and add three elements to it
        LinkedList<std::string> myFirstList = { "one" , "two", "three" };
        // now we just print
        myFirstList.printList();
    }

This works fine, but what if we want to print just "two"? We will then need to create another method that will look for it and then print it, which isn't all that bad, just two methods, now what if we want to print all elements that start with the letter "o" or if we want to create a big string out of all of them... I think you get the picture now! 
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that can access elements and perhaps also be used with great implementation from the <algorithm> standard header? For that, we need the iterator.

Let's see how we can build one!

We have to think about how can we traverse the list, how to expose a certain element and how to compare elements. Now, when you think about it traversing the list is just accessing the next element until we reach a nullptr, plus we can't traverse the list in either direction because we only have one-way access. Accessing an element means accessing its data member and eventually comparing elements means if an element is the same or not as another element.

Because we move only one way overloading the "++" operator should be sufficient and accessing an element basically means dereferencing a pointer, hence overloading the "*" operator is also needed and comparison is can be either "==" or "!=" for pointers we will just overload "!=" operator to that we can use it to see if we have reached the end of the list.

We will need to create an iterator class (or struct) that takes a pointer to the head element from the list:

    struct Iterator {
        // constructor that takes in a pointer from the linked list
        Iterator() noexcept : current_node(nullptr) {};
        Iterator(const node_ptr& node) noexcept : current_node(node.get()) {};
        
        // incrementing means going through the list
        Iterator& operator++() noexcept
        {
            if (current_node != nullptr)
            {
                previous_node = current_node;
                current_node = current_node->next.get();
            }
            return *this;
        };

        // post fixing is bad in general but it has it's usages
        Iterator operator++(int) noexcept
        {
            Iterator tempIter = *this; // we make a copy of the iterator
            ++*this; // we increment
            return tempIter; // we return the copy before increment
        };

        // we need to be able to compare nodes
        bool operator!=(const Iterator& other) const noexcept
        {
            return this->current_node !=  other.current_node;
        };

        // return the data from the node (dereference operator)
        Data operator*() const noexcept
        {
            return this->current_node->data;
        };

        private:
            const Node* previous_node = nullptr;
            const Node* current_node = nullptr;
    };

The Iterator struct will be nested as part of the LinkedList class like we did with the node since this is an iterator for this LinkedList. (it doesn't have to be)

The list will have to implement two important methods:
1. begin() - will return an iterator initialized with the head element
2. end() - will return nullptr and this will represent the end

    // returning a const pointer to the front
    Iterator begin() const noexcept
    {
        return Iterator(this->head);
    };

    // returning a const pointer to the back - the back is always null because it marks the end of the list
    Iterator end() const noexcept
    {
        return Iterator(); // this just return a nullptr that represents the end
    };

Now we can use our iterator to traverse the list as we would normally do with a simple vector:

    int main()
    {
        LinkedList<unsigned long long> longList = { 12, 3123, 4324532, 4324231313, 54654645, 654768768, 4333423545, 12123423 };
        for (const auto& item: longList) // each item returned will call the dereferencing operator on the iterator thus getting back the data from the node
        {
            std::cout << item << '\n';
        }

        // we can get an iterator that can be incremented
        auto iterator = longList.begin();
        std::cout << "This is the second element: " << *(++iterator) << '\n';
    }

At this point, the iterator we created cannot modify the list and all elements return is const, thus this can be considered and const iterator. But we can make a few simple modifications to the iterator class so that we could also insert an element while we iterate:

We have to add LinkedList as a friend class to the Iterator so that it can access its private members.
    friend class LinkedList; // the list needs to be able to access private members of the iterator for insertion

Remove const from Iterator::previous_node and Iterator::current_node.

As a final thing we will be adding a new method that inserts a new element before a specified position:

    Iterator insert(const Iterator& pos, const Data& value)
    {
        if (pos.current_node != nullptr)
        {
            node_ptr newNode = std::make_unique<Node>(value);
            newNode->next = std::move(pos.current_node->next);
            if (pos.previous_node == nullptr)
            {
                head = std::move(newNode);
                size++;
                return Iterator(head);
            }
            else
            {
                pos.previous_node->next = std::move(newNode);
                size++;
                return Iterator(pos.previous_node->next);
            }
        }
        return pos;
    };

Just as an overview of the method we can see that because we're moving the next node from current to newNode->next we can no longer return this position thus we have to return a new iterator from this position. This way we don't invalidate the iterator and we can move on with the traversal.

The entire code can be viewed here: https://github.com/BogdanAriton/starter_kit_cpp/blob/master/data-structures/lists/custom-linked-list-smart-ptrs.cpp

# Conclusions
* Building an iterator will simplify the code for the given data structure simply because the iterator is responsible for traversing the structure and not the structure itself, the structure's only responsibility is to supply the start and the end for the iterator.
* You can build various types of traversals (ex: forward, reverse, in-order, pre-order) and you can switch between these types of traversal by just changing the iterator.
* More than one traversal can be applied on the same data structure at a time because the iterator keeps track of its own traversal state.

Let's see how we can build one!
