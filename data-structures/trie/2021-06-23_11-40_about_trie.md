# Trie:
    A trie is a tree type structure that is used in most cases as a dictionary.
    The way this works is that for every word you put in you will create a node for each of the characters
    Example:
        word = "banana"
        We will need a node structure that hold the rest of the nodes in a set of nodes:
        struct Node
        {
            char value; // holds the value in that node
            unordered_map<char, Node*> nodes = {}; // this will hold the nodes linked to this node
            // we also need something that can let us know if this is the end of a word
            isWord = false; // initialized with false by default
        }

        when banana comes in:
        The root node that hold a pointer to all node will have a default like this:
        strcut Node
        {
            char value = '\0'; // this is the null char that we will ignore
            unordered_map<char, Node*> nodes = {}; // we will add a new node here with the value of the first letter in banana
            isWord = false; // this is always false for the root node
        }

        We need to iterate through the word 
        Node* current = root;
        for (auto& item : word) // for each letter found in the word
        {
            auto ptrToMapItem = current.nodes.find(item);
            if (ptrToNode == current.nodes.end()) // basically this says that if the item was not found
            {
                // we add it to the map with a new node
                Node* newNode = new Node();
                newNode->value = item;
                
                if (item == word[word.size()-1])
                {
                    newNode->isWord = true;
                }

                current.nodes.insert(item, newNode); // adding the newNode to the list in root
            }
            current = *ptrToMapItem; // we move on the the node that we found which basically mean we go through the word
        }
